# In this final step, By comparing RÂ², MAE, and MSE for each model (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks), we can identify the best performing model.
# By analyzing feature importance and correlations, we can determine which features have the most influence on predicting energy consumption. For example, temperature and humidity might have the most impact.
